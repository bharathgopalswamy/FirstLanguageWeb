<p>Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this privacy policy. By way of example (without limiting and foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government, law enforcement agencies or third parties.

<ol type="a">
  <li>External service providers: there may be a number of services offered by external service providers that help you use our websites. If you choose to use these optional services, and in the course of doing so, disclose information to the external service providers, and/or grant them permission to collect information about you, then their use of your information is governed by their privacy policy.</li>
  <li>Law and order: we cooperate with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights. We can (and you authorise us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement and other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us or you to legal liability.</li>
</ol>

<h4 style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 30px;">10. ACCESSING, REVIEWING AND CHANGING YOUR PROFILE</h4>
<p>Following registration, you can review and change the information you submitted at the stage of registration, except email id. An option for facilitating such change shall be present on the website and such change shall be facilitated by the user. If you change any information, we may or may not keep track of your old information. We will not retain in our files information you have requested to remove for certain circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our terms and conditions. Such prior information shall be completely removed from our databases, including stored ‘back up’ systems. If you believe that any information we are holding on you is incorrect or incomplete, or to remove your profile so that others cannot view it, the user needs to remediate, and promptly correct any such incorrect information.</p>
<p>To deactivate your account, you will be provided the ‘deactivate account’ option which will result in the following consequences:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Any reservations you currently have will automatically be cancelled.</li>
  <li>Your profile will be hidden.</li>
  <li>For business users, your listings will be hidden.</li>
  <li>Some information, such as reviews, may remain visible to others.</li>
</ol>

<p>When you permanently delete your account:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>We will verify your identity for security purposes before accepting the deletion request.</li>
  <li>You can’t reactivate, recover any data, or regain access to your account once it’s deleted.</li>
  <li>Any reservations you currently have will automatically be cancelled.</li>
  <li>Some of your data may remain in our systems if we are legally required or permitted to retain it.</li>
  <li>Instead of deleting certain data, we may remove or disassociate it, such that it no longer appears associated with you. Some information, such as reviews and messages you sent to other users or business users may still be visible to others.</li>
</ol>

<h4 style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 30px;">11. CONTROL OF YOUR PASSWORD</h4>
<p>When you sign up to become a user, you will also be asked to choose a password. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. It is important that you protect it against unauthorised access of your account and information by choosing your password carefully, and keeping your password and computer secure by signing out after using our services.</p>
<p>You agree not to use the account, username, email address or password of another user at any time or to disclose your password to any third party. You are responsible for all actions taken with your login information and password, including fees. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password. You agree to notify us immediately if you suspect any consistent unauthorised use of your account or access to your password even after changing it.</p>

<h4 style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 30px;">12. SECURITY</h4>
<p>We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorised access by members inside and outside the company. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us and information that we have accessed.</p>

<h4 style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 30px;">13. AMENDMENT</h4>
